<pre>
	Where  men  blindly  follow  the  truth,  remember…
	Nothing  is  true.

	Where  other  men  are  limited  by  morality  and  law,  remember…
	Everything  is  permitted.

	We  work  in  the  dark  to  serve  the  light.  We  are  assassins.  Nothing  is  		true. 
    	Everything  is  permitted. 
		-Ezio Auditore da Firenze
